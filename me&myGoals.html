            <p>Music was always a part of my life growing up. It was something that connected my family and created moments for us to remember. My siblings and I always did orchestra, band, and choir in school. We even all did musical theater together. That was where I found my start in the business side of the arts. The same organization that I started performing for at the age of 10, I was working for at the age of 18 as their Assistant Producer.  I found a love for everything that goes on in the background of a production but I knew theater wasn't where I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Music was always a constant for me. It was there when I needed a pick me up, when I needed to think, when I needed to not think, when I needed a soundtrack, and when I was happy. I know how important it is to find that perfect song or that perfect artist at just the right time to feel seen or heard. I am passionate about making those moments possible for as many people as I can. </p>

            <p>We have all had a moment in our lives where a song or artist reached us when we needed it most. I want to make sure that artists have the platform and support they need to reach the audience that needs to hear them. </p>
